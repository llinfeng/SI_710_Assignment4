\section{Experiment Design}
\subsection{Motivation}
The purpose of this study is to see how the presence of social networks affects
trading patterns and, by extension, the efficiency of decentralized markets.


\subsubsection{Social Network Implementation}
Real world, existing friendships.

\subsection{Experiment Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly assign subjects into two groups, treatment and control.
        (Please refer to section ``Subjects, Control and Treatment'')
    \item Elicit network of treatment group (Please refer to section ``Network
        Elicitation Method'')
    \item Computer based trading: treatment with real ID; control with changing
        fake ID. Subject can post unbinding offers publicly but they can
        negotiate (private chatting) as well. (Please refer to section ``Market
        mechanism'')
    \item At the end of each round, subject will observe the average price or
        distribution(we can discuss which one is better) (just like
        ``truecar.com'')
    \item Subject will be reward the surplus they earned in the experiment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Subjects, Control and Treatment}
The experiment will be run in a computer-based trading setting among a class of
undergraduate students, such as ECON 401. The main advantage of the selected
group of subjects is the easy access and the fact that we would not need
parental consent. This course is chosen since it is still a mass course and
provides students with enough time to establish a network in college. Hence, the
measured social network will be the existing friendship network among students.

In order to measure the importance of social networks on decentralized
competitive markets and the choice of trading partners, subjects are randomly
selected from the course and assigned into three groups of 25 individuals. The
size of each group is selected to make the elicitation mechanism possible and convenient.

In the treatment group I, students are identified with their real names which
implies that the subjects are able to recognized trading partners with whom they
have a closer social relationship. After the trading experiment is run, the
social network of the treatment group is going to be elicited.

In the treatment group II, students are identified with their pictures (without their names) which again
implies that the subjects are able to recognized each other.  After the trading experiment is run, the
social network of this second treatment group will be elicited.

In the control
group I, subjects are not identified and are randomly assign with a fake ID. Note
that in both groups, the market design is identical except from the fact that in
one group subjects are identifiable by names or picture whereas in the other they are not.

Moreover, three more groups of 24 students are going t be randomly selected from the behavioral subject pool in order to have three groups of people with a low probability of knowing each other.

In the treatment group III, students are identified again with their real names and in treatment group IV students are identified with their picture. In the control
group II, subjects are not identified and are randomly assign with a fake ID.

The choice of this methodology allows us to identify how the social network
 and how the method of providing identification influences the trading patterns among subjects. For instance, based  on  the  comparison  of Control  I  and  Treatment  I,  we  expect  that  subjects  are  more  likely  to  trade with individuals who belong to their social network.  Comparing Control I and Treatment II, we expect that subjects will similar characteristics will tend to trade with each other.

\subsection{Market Mechanism}
We are focusing on a computer based double auction environment. Buyers are looking for a single unit to buy, sellers have only one unit to sell in our setting. The ask and bid
offers are going to be posted in a publicly available fashion. In contrast to
the transparency of the prices, agents will be able to privately chat and
negotiate. The transactions will be realized once both parties agree on it. Furthermore, we will shut the chatting feature for the parties who have already settled for a transaction. \\

We will have 5 rounds of 5 minutes long sessions. A count-down clock will be integrated into the experimental interface.\\

Notice that chatting has some costs incorporated in itself such as: (a) they might miss a good price in the market while chatting, (b) they might be embarrassed ti ask for a lower/higher price.

\subsection{Hypothesis and Testing}
\subsubsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}[{Hypothesis} 1]
    \item Subjects will be more likely to trade with individuals who are in
        their social network.
    \item Bargaining costs will be lower when access to social networks is
        available.
    \item Efficiency will be higher in homogeneous good markets when networks
        are available. This is expected to be due to lower trading costs.
    \item Price dispersion will be greater in markets where social networks are
        available. In other words, the Law of One Price is less likely to hold.
    \item Surplus will be split more equally in markets with social networks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Testing Hypothesis}
\begin{enumerate}[{Hypothesis} 1]
    \item  Utilizing the elicited network, compute the frequency to within network
        transaction of treatment group, compare it with no network effect
        probability.
    \item  Compute means and standard deviations of bargaining time of control
        group, treatment group ( a.total transactions; b.transactions within
        network; c. transactions outside of network), then calculate $p$-value to check
        statistic significance.
    \item  Compute total surplus achieved in each round in both control and
        treatment, then calculate the statistic difference of these two.
    \item Compute means and standard deviations of price dispersion in each round of
        control group, treatment group ( a.total transactions; b.transactions within
        network; c. transactions outside of network), then calculate $p$-value to check
        statistic significance.
    \item Compute means and standard deviations of surplus splitting ratio (sell
            surplus/buyer surplus) in each round of control group, treatment group (
            a.total transactions; b.transactions within network; c. transactions outside of
        network), then calculate $p$-value to check statistic significance.
