\section{Experiment Design}
Social Network Implementation
Real world, existing friendships

Experiment Procedure
1. Randomly assign subjects into two groups, treatment and control. (Please refer to section “Subjects, Control and Treatment”)
2. Eliciate network of treatment group (Please refer to section “Network Elicitation Method”)
3. Computer based trading: treatment with real ID; control with changing fake ID. Subject can post unbinding offers publicly but they can negotiate (private chatting) as well. (Please refer to section “Market mechanism”)
4. At the end of each round, subject will observe the average price or distribution(we can discuss which one is better) (just like “truecar.com”)
5. Subject will be reward the surplus they earned in the experiment.

\subsection{``Control vs. Treatment group''}
The experiment will be run in a computer-based trading setting among a class of undergraduate students, such as ECON 102. The main advantage of the selected group of subjects is the easy access and the fact that we would not need parental consent. This course is chosen since it is still a mass course and provides students with enough time to establish a network in college. Hence, the measured social network will be the existing friendship network among students.

In order to measure the importance of social networks on decentralized competitive markets and the choice of trading partners, subjects are randomly selected from the course and assigned into two groups of 25 individuals. The size of each group is selected to make the elicitation mechanism possible. (if not it is too long)

In the treatment group, students are identified with their real names which implies that the subjects are able to recognized trading partners with whom they have a closer social relationship. After the trading experiment is run, the social network of the treatment group is going to be elicited. In the control group, subjects are not identified and are randomly assign with a fake ID. Note that in both groups, the market design is identical except from the fact that in one group subjects are identifiable whereas in the other they are not.

The choice of this methodology allows us to identify how the social network influences the trading patterns among subjects. We expect that subjects are more likely to trade with individuals who belong to their social network. 

\subsection{Market Mechanism}


\subsection{Hypothesis and Testing}
Motivation
The purpose of this study is to see how the presence of social networks affects trading patterns and, by extension, the efficiency of decentralized markets.

Hypotheses

• Hypothesis 1: Subjects will be more likely to trade with individuals who are in their social network. 

• Hypothesis 2: Bargaining costs will be lower when access to social networks is available. 

• Hypothesis 3: Efficiency will be higher in homogeneous good markets when networks are available. This is expected to be due to lower trading costs.  

• Hypothesis 4: Price dispersion will be greater in markets where social networks are available. In other words, the Law of One Price is less likely to hold. 

• Hypothesis 5: Surplus will be split more equally in markets with social networks.

• Hypothesis 6: Friends with stronger “ties” will trade more items than friends with weak “ties”, if anything at all.
